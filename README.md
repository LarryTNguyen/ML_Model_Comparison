# ML_Model_Comparison

This report includes a recreation of the report “An Empirical Comparison of Supervised Learning Algorithms” by Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil. The reference report was published in 2006 and so I aim to see how well the results hold up 18 years later when the models are more available to the public. I selected five models from the study to compare with each other: Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Neural Networks (NN), and AdaBoost (AdaBoost). In addition to selecting similar models to the report, I also used one of the performance criteria listed in the report to evaluate the learning methods.
